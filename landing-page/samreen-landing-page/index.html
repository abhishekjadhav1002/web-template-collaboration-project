          <p>
            Oranges are popular due to their natural sweetness, the many different types available, and the diversity of uses. For example, 
            a person can consume them in juices and marmalades, eat them whole, or use zested peel to add a tangy flavor to cakes and desserts.
          </p>
          <p>This popular citrus fruit is particularly known for its vitamin C content. However, oranges contain a range of other plant compounds and 
            antioxidants that may reduce inflammation and work against disease.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this article, we look at the many health benefits of oranges, their nutritional profile, and how to include more in the diet.
